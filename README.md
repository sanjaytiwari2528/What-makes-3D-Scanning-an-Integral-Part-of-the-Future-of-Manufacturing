# What-makes-3D-Scanning-an-Integral-Part-of-the-Future-of-Manufacturing
Production issues are inevitable. In order to ensure that all parts meet quality control and customer requirements, manufacturers must constantly adjust their processes as per the latest trends in technology. This is where 3D scanning comes in. 3D scanning is a flexible, versatile technology that has revolutionized manufacturing and engineering processes across industries. <br>

**What is 3D Scanning?** <br>
3D scanning is a technology that assists in the creation of high-precision 3D models of real-world objects. Like their 2D scanners, 3D scanners take a physical object in the real world and digitize it into a format that can be saved, edited, and shared on a device. Once in a digital format, the 3D models derived from 3D scanners can help in engineering, designing, and quality assurance processes in various industries. <br>

Just as 2D photos are made up of pixels, 3D scans are made up of tiny triangles, also called polygons. Polygons come together to form a polygonal mesh that replicates the geometry of the object in minute detail. <br>

**Reasons to use 3D Scanning** <br>
3D scanning has changed the process of manufacturing in many industries from jewelry designing to car manufacturing. If you hire the best 3D scanning services for manufacturing your products, it can help your manufacturing process in many ways as: <br>

1. It saves designing time: When a pre-existing product needs design or part up-gradation, 3D scanning proves helpful as it is a time-saving option as compared to hand-drawn calculations. The scanner can scan every nook and detail of the existing product and provide precise dimensions to give an idea of where the new part must fit. <br>

2. It makes the product prototyping faster: Creating a perfect product prototype requires several attempts. With 3D scanning, this process can be accelerated and the number of prototype cycles can also be reduced. A scanner does not just measure the cross-sections and identifies the areas where the modifications can be made, but also saves all the data related to the scan. Thus, when the time comes to scan a new version of the prototype, the comparison of data is faster and easier. <br>

3. It leads to faster and more comprehensive quality control: 3D scanners are extremely accurate and precise. They also help in checking the composition of the material and the volume of the object. In today’s highly competitive market, this proves extremely beneficial for manufacturing and quality control purposes. A manufactured object or prototype can be scanned to check the quality of design, scale, and stability with extreme accuracy. This data can be compared to the original CAD design to find deviations that are shown by displaying the data in a 3D deviation color map. <br>

4. Ability to remanufacture parts without using CAD: 3D scanning helps in remanufacturing a part that originated before computer-aided design (CAD) software was available by making it possible to produce accurate reproductions of the product. The scanner can also be used to compare the newly created part/ product prototype to check the accuracy with the old part. <br>

5. Easy comparison of designs to manufactured products: Another benefit of a 3D scanner is the ability it provides to compare the designed model to the built model. This helps in ensuring that the original vision came to fruition. Comparing the designs also ensures that the manufactured product/ part will work as needed. For example, helping an engineer know whether the printed part will fit as required in an automobile.  <br>

**Applications of 3D Scanning** <br>
Although 3D scanning is used in many industries, there are some areas in which 3D scanning greatly helps in the manufacturing processes. This is partly because of the advances in technology that have allowed scanners to become smaller, more portable, and more powerful. Some of the main industries where 3D scanning services in Pune prove useful are: <br>

•	Medical Industry: In the medical sector, 3D scans help to create made-to-measure prosthetics for patients that have incredible accuracy, comfort, and mobility. It is also quite popular in the dental sector where it can be used to stimulate options to even create dental devices like braces, implants, and dentures. <br>

•	Engineering & Product Designing: Another area with a huge potential for 3D scanning is engineering. This is due to their ability to quickly and precisely capture the required data. Traditionally, measurements would have to be taken by manual methods which can prove to be too costly and time-consuming. <a href="https://www.exelus3d.com/services/3d-scanning/">3D scanning services in India</a> can help you in designing, testing, developing, launching, and in the aftercare of products which helps avoid costly mistakes and enhances productivity. <br>

•	Art & Design: 3D scanning provides artists with limitless possibilities, by enabling them to convert their most brilliant ideas into reality. It helps in the movie industry and video game creation. Many effects and stunts would be difficult to achieve without 3D scanning. 3D scanning services in Pune also help in preserving monuments and historical artifacts by digitizing them in 3D to preserve their exact copies as the objects themselves can disintegrate over a period of time. <br>
